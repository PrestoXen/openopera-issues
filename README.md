# OpenOpera Issues
This is the issue tracker for OpenOpera, the code is hosted elsewhere (tip: search for prestocore-fan)

Anyone can make an issue here, for anything (suggestions, issue, bug reports...), within reason.

Feel free to join the OpenOpera IRC: http://site.anonnet.org/webirc/openopera  
Or join #openopera on crowley.anonnet.org:6697

A collection of patches for Opera 12.15 can be found at https://github.com/PrestoXen/openopera-patches
